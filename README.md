# Horiseon Social Solution Services (Challenge 1)

# Fixing Website Accessibility and SEO 

# Description

## The is project was designed to edit an existing website for a marketing company. The client is seeking greater accessibility for their webpage by adding alternative text images and icons. The project also entailed editing different sections to increase search engine optimization by changing most div tags to section, article, or aside tags instead. The website features three clickable links to sections lower down on the webpage.


# Installation

## Installation can be done by downloading the files directly to your computer from a .zip file or by cloning the files from the repository directly using Github's link or SSH key link. If you are unfamiliar with using Github's repositories there are many resources to look up and from there it is pretty self-explanatory.

# Usage

## The usage of this page is create a working HTML and CSS webpage for the client Horiseon Social Solution Services. The three clickable links should be working and the aside should be to the side. All three sections should be in blue boxes with an image next to each text element.
